Hi, my name is George and today I'm going to be&nbsp;
walking you through our visualization for our Beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.900
the Book project. We're first going to start on&nbsp;
this visualization on the left, on the x-axis we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.160
have sports books, you can see each sports book&nbsp;
listed out, we also have sports books sorted by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.560
color, the color obviously corresponds to which&nbsp;
color the dot is, and on the y-axis we have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.300
difference between the average spreads so we can&nbsp;
see which games have the biggest change in spreads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
based on where they are positioned on the y-axis.&nbsp;
For this example I'm going to be pretending we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.840
in Massachusetts and trying to place a bet, so we&nbsp;
have our state filter here in the center, what I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.420
going to do is I'm going to uncheck all of them&nbsp;
and then I'm going to pick just Massachusetts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320
If you're going between states or you have a&nbsp;
couple different states that you can bet in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.040
you can obviously pick multiple, but for this&nbsp;
example we're going to be doing Massachusetts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.380
So let's say I'm sitting here and I look at&nbsp;
this Dallas Mavericks at Sacramento Kings game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.840
so that means the Sacramento Kings are at home I&nbsp;
can see that the home team has a six point spread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.660
and the away team also has a six point spread&nbsp;
which means the Kings are projected to win by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.460
six points and the Mavericks are projected to&nbsp;
lose by six points. So let's say I see this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.800
and I see all right, that's from betonline.ag,&nbsp;
then I'm going over and I see another Dallas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.380
Mavericks versus Sacramento Kings game, this&nbsp;
one from mybookie.ag. If I want to click on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.560
I can see that the home team is now favored by&nbsp;
six and a half points and the away team is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.480
supposed to lose by six and a half&nbsp;
points. So if I was a betting man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.020
I would choose to bet with mybookie.ag because if&nbsp;
the Kings end up winning by six points, instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.060
getting a push, I'm gonna actually win my bet&nbsp;
because I had six and a half compared to six.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.140
We also have on visualization two&nbsp;
the away price for money lines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.580
and yeah, that's pretty much it.&nbsp;
Thank you so much for watching.
