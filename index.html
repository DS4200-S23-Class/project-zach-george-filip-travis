    <h1>Informing Sports Bettors</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        Sports betting is only growing. Since sport betting first became legal in 2018 people 
        have gone from placing 4.5 billion dollars in bets to 79 billion in 2022. As more states 
        continue to legalize sports betting this number will only grow. Along with this growth more 
        and more sports books have entered the market. This saturated betting market is causing new 
        and experienced bettors to question if there go to bookie is giving them the best odds. We 
        are creating a visualization tool to solve this issue and provide users with confidence before 
        placing a bet. 
        <p>
            Provide an introduction/motivation for your project. Include the domain area your 
            project addresses, the domain problem it seeks to solve, why solving this problem is 
            important, and an overview of the use case for your tool.
        </p>

            This project intends to, at a baseline, inform users' sports bets. Each sportsbook has 
            different biases and odds that depend on a multitude of factors. With our visualization,
            we will convey these biases in a concise and readable manner to allow users to quickly 
            find the necessary information when they want to place a bet. Our information needs to 
            be quickly accessible and digestible as betting odds are quickly changing. The three 
            main goals of our visualization are: compare the general performance of user bets by 
            sportsbook, compare specific bet performance across multiple sportsbooks, and to allow 
            users to understand which sportsbook to use (in a more broad sense) for which sports. 
            These domain goals are important to support as sportsbooks are very good at masking 
            their biases and intentions as seen in the related work section of this paper.

            Specifically, we are focusing on game odds for the NBA. Finding the right 
            site to bet on is extremely difficult. With odds constantly changing and slight 
            discrepancies between bookies locking in a bet with the best odds is nearly impossible. 
            However, this does not have to be the case! By using a bet API, we can download, clean, 
            and visualize bets across different betting sites. By creating a visualization to show 
            what bookie to bet with sports betters can be comfortable knowing they got the best 
            odds. There is a clear use case for this project: to beat the book.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        TODO: Add link to report, demo video, link to data etc. here  
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <a href="data/Sports_bets_NBA.ipynb">Notebook</a>
        <br>
        <a href="data/NBA_Bets_Today.csv">Data CSV</a>
        <p>
            The data is collected by <a href="https://the-odds-api.com/">the odds api</a>. It is 
            currently set up to only pull today's games but the dataset could be expanded. It is 
            unknown how they get it because after trying to webscape betting sites there is no way 
            that is their solution. Many different betting sites offer paid API usage or have a 
            minimum balance requirement to use their API so they probably just get it from that. 
            However, regardless of how they get the data they have comprehensive betting data across
            multiple sports and leagues that is up to date when I check the sites manually. It is 
            strictly spreads and money line odds so there should be no bias as sport betting 
            companies are trying to make money. There are often deals that different companies put 
            out to get new bettors. One of the main reasons for this project is to find the best 
            ones and exploit them. There are no missing values nor true outliers. After reading in 
            the data using a Jupyter notebook, the data was cleaned using python before exporting it 
            to a .csv. For the cleaning in Python, first the game column was split into home and 
            away teams to avoid confusion, and then renamed the columns in accordance with home and 
            away. Numerous duplicate columns were also deleted and renamed so they made more sense. 
            Lastly, the data was grouped by game ID and then Bookie so bets are sorted by game and 
            the bookies spread and ML bets are next to each other.
